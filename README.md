# CSCI 201
These are my codes uploaded to the Computer Science 201 course during college.

<!--Information-->
## Information
This simple README file will link to each module's Markdown file to explain every single program and their intended use depending on the assignment and module. Each folder in this repository will will correspond to a module in which you can look at the code and see how it works.
Let me know if there's something I can fix in my codes up in the issues tab and I'll take a look at it as soon as possible.
